        I am SadÄ±k a determined and skilled Full-Stack Web Developer with 
        the strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        combined with proficiency in back-end development and server-side technologies like Node.js and Express.
        My portfolio features a wide range of creative and functional web applications.
        Every project I worked on was committed to producing high-quality code and user-friendly interfaces.<br /><br />
        I began my education during the COVID pandemic and soon discovered that the internet is where I am most passionate. Then I made a hard decision and shifted from environmental engineering to web development.
        As a dedicated and independent learner, I found the Odin Project to be the ideal resource for my education in web programming. 
        After that, I am continuously enhancing my skills to keep up with the latest trends and best practices in web development.<br /><br />
        Beside coding, I enjoy walking, reading books and mangas, playing video games, and role-playing games. Rock music, sci-fi, dark fantasy worlds and football are some of my favorite things.
